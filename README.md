# Task
We need to develop an Internet resource for a fan-made MMORPG server - something like a bulletin board. Users of our resource should be able to register in it by e-mail, having received a letter with a registration confirmation code. After registration, they can create and edit adverts. Adverts consist of a title and text that can include images, videos, and other content. Users can submit responses to other users' adverts with text. When sending a response, the user should receive an e-mail with a notification about it. The user should also have access to a private page with responses to his adverts, inside which he can filter responses by adverts, delete them and accept (when a response is accepted, the user who left the response should also receive a notification). In addition, the user must define an advert in one of the following categories: Tanks, Heals, DDs, Traders, Guildmasters, Questgivers, Blacksmiths, Tanners, Potions Masters, Spellmasters.
